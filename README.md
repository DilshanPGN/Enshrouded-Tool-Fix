This utility is intended for those who have problems with the game Enshrouded.

It allows you to test your system for various problems with the Vulkan graphics API and help fix them.

It does not give a 100% guarantee that it will help you, but it may clarify some points. This utility was written for my system and nVidia video card, and it is quite possible that it will not work properly on yours.

I tried to take into account many factors to prevent this from happening.
